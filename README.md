This is a version of the arcade classic Breakout! for the Arduino platform. (For an example of gameplay, see: http://www.play.vg/games/10-Breakout.html).

This version was developed and runs on the Arduino Mega 2560. It uses the Adafruit ST7735 LCD module for output and a (10k) analog joystick for input.
