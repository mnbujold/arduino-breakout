This is a version of the arcade classic Breakout! for the Arduino platform. (For an example of gameplay, see: http://www.play.vg/games/10-Breakout.html).

This version was developed and runs on the Arduino Mega 2560. It uses the Adafruit ST7735 LCD module for output and a (10k) analog joystick for input. 

Known Issues:

Features to be Added:
- 'Lives' counter (LEDs)
- Adjustable ball speed (using pot)
- Sound
- Scoring
- Ball 'physics' (eg. spin, speed, angle)
- High Score Storage (Maybe...)

Special Thanks:  
The great and powerful Woz - who inspired the idea for this implementation.
